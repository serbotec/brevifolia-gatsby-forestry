# “the mistery of the _bridge between the conscious and the unconscious_”

Since the first school enrollment we learn to rationalize our thinking. An action should always have reasons. To built a reason we need to make assumptions, and to create logical formulation of the problem.   
  
As the time passes, we surrender ourselves with the overflow. Each day, we need to decide and act more quickly. The process of reasoning needs more computation power in shorter time. Now, we start our first job with alot of processing power ready to make decision in the uncertain and complex business world. 

Therefore, we need to make decisions more frequently with little information. As we go higher in the position we need to make key assumptions about problems within the time constraints that the measures require, we have evolved to make a lot of approximations to bypass our brain cylces. This is where we find bias. 

There are methods to elimante the bias as such Reversal test

Daniel Kahnemann 

But to be fair our minds are not capable of this.  
  
How many times have you decided with your guts and after rationlized the decision?

Time to think gets shorter . Our brain cycles needs more computation power and the energy 

Rational decisions information within the technology products.  and surpass our gifts in the background 

think more as machine to rationalize everything. 

  
We begin

Have you counted rational decisions

But what if we have already a reason to a problem without any logical formulation?

and to think as machines. We surrender ourself to noises, where we need to describe our act and thinking. Before acting, we must create an empathy and understanding to encode the high volatile noises in the current world.

Intuition is the state that bridges the sounds in the highly volatile ambiguous, complex and uncertain noises.

What makes intuition special?

Why are many not able to enter the bridge?

\-Whats differs us when machine can become conscoius?

How can we trust upcoming talents with a strong intuition?

Intuition as incubator (technology)

Intuition as drive (sport)
